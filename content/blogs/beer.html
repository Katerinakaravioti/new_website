<p>What can you infer from these plots? Don’t just explain what’s in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We shall begin by stating the top-consuming countries in each category. We will try to identify the causes and detect a pattern based on that.</p>
<p>France, Portugal and Andorra are the top three countries in terms of average wine consumption. This probably happens because wine consumption in these countries is part of the countries’ culture and they drink it with their meals.</p>
<p>Similarly, Namibia, Czech Republic and Gabon are the countries with the highest beer consumption. Grenada, Belarus and Haiti are the top three countries in terms of average spirit consumption and we could infer that people tend to drink a lot in their everyday life.</p>
<p>Following the same pattern, Grenada and Haiti are among the top producers of traditional spiritis of the Carribean region (specifically, rum), and hence might have a strong tradition of consuming them. In addition, the breakdown of total alcohol consumption might be skewed towards these spirits, since wine is a very expensive product for these low-income countries. Belarus, another top spirit-consuming country, might be a special case. Due to weakness of its national currency, Belarus is well-known as an alcohol purchases hub for all its neighbours. Hence, its calculated per capita domestic spirit consumption could be strongly overestimated in case sales of spirits are used as a proxy to consumption.</p>
<p>Overall, consumption of different alcohol drinks is largely tied to local production capacities (e.g. Italy, Argentina or Greece for wines) and consumption traditions. In addition, income might also be a relevant explanatory variables. Countries with top wine production tend to be economically very prosperous (with a notable exception for Equatorial Guinea), while consumption of spirits is most established in developing countries where population cannot afford expensive alcohol.</p>
