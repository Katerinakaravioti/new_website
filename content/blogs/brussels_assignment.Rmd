Even though there are many variables in the dataframe, here is a quick description of some of the variables collected, and you can find a [data dictionary here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896)

- `price` = cost per night 
- `property_type`: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)
- `room_type`:

  - Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
  - Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
  - Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)

- `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews for the listing
- `review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)
- `longitude` , `latitude`: geographical coordinates to help us locate the listing
- `neighbourhood*`: three variables on a few major neighbourhoods in each city 


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Raw values
```{r}
glimpse(listings)
```
- How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations?
**Answer:** 74 variables and 5442 rows.
- Which variables are numbers?
**Answer:** Columns which have a type of <dbl>, eg.id, scrape_id, host_id, host_listings_count, host_total_listings_count, latitude, longitude...
- Which are categorical or *factor* variables (numeric or character variables with variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values?
**Answer:** Some columns with a type of <chr>, including host_response_time, host_neighbourhood, neighbourhood_cleansed, property_type, room_type. 

##Summary statistics
```{r}
skim(listings)
```

##Visualizations
1. The room scale effects in regression
- 'accommodates' and 'beds' have a correlation of 0.785, thus should not be both included in regression
```{r}
listings$price <- readr::parse_number(listings$price)

listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(lg_price = log(price)) 

ggpairs(listings, columns = c("lg_price", "bedrooms", "beds", "accommodates"))
```

2. The availability effects in regression
- 'availability_30' has the largest correlation with price
```{r}

ggpairs(listings, columns = c("lg_price", "availability_30","availability_60", "availability_90", "availability_365"))
```

3. The review effects in regression 
- we can select one of those review scores to include 
- 'reviews_per_month' may has a significant effect on price
```{r}

ggpairs(listings, columns = c("lg_price", "number_of_reviews", "review_scores_rating", "review_scores_accuracy", "review_scores_cleanliness", "review_scores_checkin", "review_scores_communication", "review_scores_location", "review_scores_value", "reviews_per_month"))
```

4. potential variables
```{r}
ggpairs(listings, columns = c("lg_price", "bedrooms", "accommodates", "availability_30", "number_of_reviews", "review_scores_cleanliness", "reviews_per_month"))
```

5. boxplot of neighbourhood_cleansed
- Bruxelles may be considered into model
```{r}

listings %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = factor(neighbourhood_cleansed), y = lg_price)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.33, color = "red", size = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "neighbourhood_cleansed", y = "log(price)")
```

6. histogram of property type
```{r}

listings %>% 
  group_by(property_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lg_price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~property_type, scales= "free")+
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "log(price)", y = "")
```

7. histogram of room type
```{r}

listings %>% 
  group_by(room_type) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lg_price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~room_type, scales= "free")+
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "log(price)", y = "")
```


- What are the correlations between variables? Does each scatterplot support a linear relationship between variables? Do any of the correlations appear to be conditional on the value of a categorical variable?
**Answer:** The correlations can not exactly be defined as linear through the scatterplot. However, most pairs have a upward and downward of trend, especially for log(price). For property type and room type, the price has a obvious correlation with some specific type which may be conditional correlations. 

## Data wrangling

Once you load the data, it's always a good idea to use `glimpse` to see what kind of variables you have and what data type (`chr`, `num`, `logical`, `date`, etc) they are. 

Notice that some of the price data (`price`) is given as a character string, e.g., "$176.00"

Since `price` is a quantitative variable, we need to make sure it is stored as numeric data `num` in the dataframe. To do so, we will first use `readr::parse_number()` which drops any non-numeric characters before or after the first number


```{r}
typeof(listings$price)

listings %>% group_by(property_type) %>% summarise(counts = count(property_type)) %>% arrange(desc(counts))
```


Use `typeof(listing$price)` to confirm that `price` is now stored as a number.


## Propery types


Next, we look at the variable `property_type`. We can use the `count` function to determine how many categories there are their frequency. What are the top 4 most common property types? What proportion of the total listings do they make up? 

Since the vast majority of the observations in the data are one of the top four or five property types, we would like to create a simplified version of `property_type` variable that has 5 categories: the top four categories and `Other`. Fill in the code below to create `prop_type_simplified`.

```{r}
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in rental unit", "Entire condominium (condo)","Private room in residential home") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
  
```
Use the code below to check that `prop_type_simplified` was correctly made.

```{r}
listings %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))      

#delete the variable we no longer need:
listings$property_type <- NULL
```        

Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes, i.e., as an alternative to traditional hotels. We only want to include  listings in our regression analysis that are intended for travel purposes:

- What are the  most common values for the variable `minimum_nights`? 
```{r}

listings %>% group_by(minimum_nights) %>% summarize(values = count(minimum_nights)) %>% arrange(desc(values))
```
- Is ther any value among the common values that stands out? 

**Answer**: the value of 90 days, which likely stands out as a proxy to long-term rent.


- What is the likely intended purpose for Airbnb listings with this seemingly unusual value for `minimum_nights`?

**Answer**: Long-term rent

Filter the airbnb data so that it only includes observations with `minimum_nights <= 4`

```{r}
listings <- listings %>% filter(minimum_nights <= 4)

 

```
        
# Mapping 

Visualisations of feature distributions and their relations are key to understanding a data set, and they can open up new lines of exploration. While we do not have time to go into all the wonderful geospatial visualisations one can do with R, you can use the following code to start with a map of your city, and overlay all AirBnB coordinates to get an overview of the spatial distribution of AirBnB rentals. For this visualisation we use the `leaflet` package, which includes a variety of tools for interactive maps, so you can easily zoom in-out, click on a point to get the actual AirBnB listing for that specific point, etc.

The following code, having downloaded a dataframe `listings` with all AirbnB listings in Milan, will plot on the map all AirBnBs where `minimum_nights` is less than equal to four (4). You could learn more about `leaflet`, by following [the relevant Datacamp course on mapping with leaflet](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-maps-with-leaflet-in-r)

**Note:** below we added the visualization with a heatmap (i.e. color is differentiated depending on the price of accomodation)

```{r, out.width = '80%'}

#Create a heatmap of the prices:
listings$price_cuts <- cut(listings$price, 
                        quantile(listings$price), include.lowest = T,
                        labels = c('<50%', '50-100%', '100-150%', '150-200%'))
heatmap_colors <- colorFactor(palette = 'RdYlGn', listings$price_cuts)

leaflet(data = filter(listings, minimum_nights <= 4)) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   color = ~heatmap_colors(listings$price_cuts), 
                   fillOpacity = 0.3, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~prop_type_simplified)
#delete the redundant column:
listings$price_cuts <- NULL


#Note - we need to add legend to this :)
```
