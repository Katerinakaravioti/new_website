```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE,

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset
  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

```{r}
apply(movies, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))


```
**Answer:** As we can see, all colunms of the dataframe contain to missing values.

```{r}
duplicates <- duplicated(movies)
print(sum(duplicates == "TRUE"))

```
**Answer: **Apparently, there are no duplicate entries in the dataset. Hence, all entries in the dataset are distinct.

- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order

```{r}
#Arrange movies by genre in descending order:
movies %>% count(genre) %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% mutate(Genre := genre, Quantity := n, genre := NULL, n := NULL)
```

- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r}
#The below table summarizes mean earnings (box office) and mean budget by genre. Entries are ranked by the "return on budget" variable
library(data.table)
movies <- as.data.table(movies)
movies_by_genre <- movies %>% group_by(genre) %>% summarize(mean_earnings := mean(gross), mean_budget := mean(budget))
movies_by_genre %>% mutate(return_on_budget =  mean_earnings/mean_budget) %>% arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
```

- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r}
#Below table provides descriptive statistics of box offices of 15 top-earning directors
movies %>% group_by(director) %>% summarize(total_gross := sum(gross), mean_gross := mean(gross), median_gross := median(gross), sd_gross := sd(gross)) %>% arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>% head(15)
```

- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 

```{r}
#Descriptive statistics of movies summarized by genre are provided below:
movies %>% group_by(genre) %>% summarize( mean_rating := mean(rating), median_rating := median(rating), sd_rating := sd(rating), min_rating := min(rating), max_rating := max(rating)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_rating))

```

```{r}
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Ratings by Genre")
```
